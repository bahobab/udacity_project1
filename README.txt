2. What's included:
------------------


The movie trailer project includes four(4) files:



- [1] media.py
-> a python file that contains the definition of the class(es) for the movie objects


- [2] entertainment_center.py:
-> a python file that contains the instanciation of the movie class(es), creates the list of the movie to show on the web page. within this file 'fresh_tomatoes.py' (described next) is called with the list of class intances as input


- [3] fresh_tomatoes.py:
-> a python file that takes a list of movie instances then dynamically generates and open an html web page (fresh_tomatoes.html)


- [4] fresh_tomatoes.html:

media.py contains the definition of a base class called 'entertainment'.

Three(3) other classes are derived from that base class:
- 'Film' class (for feature films and documentaries)

4. Limitations:


--------------
1. Presentation:

I run into the issues of alignment of the boxes when the height of the columns are not the same.
I tried without success to remedy the issues with the clearfix class in css.
Finally, to satisfy the basic requirement of the project I managed to fill in the information for the movies such that the columns have the same heights



2. Coding classes

:
There are class variables that were defined but not used. They could be used for concistancy for some fields such as RATINGS, TvSTATION, GENRE etc...
